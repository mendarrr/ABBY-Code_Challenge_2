### By Abby Sarah Ombuna 

# Description
It is a series of three different challenges which aim at testing the topics that were covered during the week. The challenges include:

## Challenge 1:
### Qn
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character.
### Soln
This is a program which which swaps the case of each character in the sring. It takes the input string as a variable. the function caseSwap() is called with the string being the argument.The function then iterates through each character in the string using a for-loop. If the character is in uppercase, the function converts it to lowercase and vice versa. The funcion then returns a new string with the swapped cases. The reault is storedin the declared variable. The program outputs the result to the terminal.

## Challenge 2:
### Qn
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them
### Soln
This is a program which generates an array of numbers between two integers, inclusive. Ittakes the input of two integers as variables. The function generateArray() is called with the input integers as the arguments. The function checks whether the first number is greater than the other integer. If so, an error message is displayed because the last number should be greater than the first number. If the first number is less than or equal to the second, the function initialises an empty array called result. A for-loop is used to iterate fromthe first number to the last , inclusive. For each iteration, the function pushes the current number to the result array which, in the end, is the return of the function. The result is stored in the declared variable and the program outputs the result to the terminal

## Challenge 3:
### Qn
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array
### Soln
The program checks for prime numbers in a given range of numbers. The program has two functions. The isPrime() is called to check whether a number is prime or not. (A prime number is a number that only has two factors; 1 and itself only). The checkPrimeNumbers() is called to check for prime numbers within the range. It checks if the the input is a number . If not, the user is prompted to enter a number. If the test passes, the function initialises an empty array called primeNumbers. A for-loop is used to iterate through from the first number up to the last number,inclusive. For each iteration the function tests if the number is prime and if it is, it is pushed to the primeNumbers array which is the return of the function. The result is stored in the primeNumbers variable and outputs the result to the terminal.

## Installation:
1. Install Node.js on your computer.
2. Download the program and save it to a directory.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the needed program is located.
4. Run the command 'node filename.js'.
5. Enter the input when propmted.

## Requirements:
1. Node.js
2. A Terminal
